In short, an overfit algorithm goes beyond just learning the nature and statistical properties data, it learns the particular intricacies of the specific examples in the dataset. Hence, it deviates from learning the trends in the data and learning the irrelevant noise in it. In other words, an overfit algorithm loses sight of the forest for the trees.
